FastAPI, REST API principles for handling GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

In this project, I leverage FastAPI, a Python web framework, to create a robust backend for a RESTful API with MySQL database integration. Utilizing SQLAlchemy, we establish a connection to MySQL and perform CRUD operations seamlessly. FastAPI's automatic generation of OpenAPI and Swagger documentation simplifies API exploration.

For the GET operation, we retrieve data from the MySQL database and expose it through API endpoints. POST requests enable the creation of new records, while PUT requests facilitate updates, maintaining data integrity. DELETE operations efficiently remove records.

FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities enhance performance, ensuring swift API responses. With Swagger UI, developers can interactively test and document the API effortlessly. This project exemplifies the power of FastAPI in building efficient, scalable, and well-documented REST APIs with MySQL integration, adhering to industry-standard CRUD principles.
